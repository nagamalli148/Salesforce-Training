The term object referes to information.We use database tabkes  to collect or store the information about the things,peopleor concepts that are important 

Salesforce database structure:
->Standard objects-Predefined
->Custom Objects -created by users according to their need
->External objects -Custom obj which are used to mao the data stored outside your organization.

The information in the table is stored as rows and columns

Move the fields to the right and click on save

Schema Builder- useful while creating objects

New Custom Object
Name:Trainer ID
autonumber
T-{00000}
starting number:1

Do not check this option for this for now!

When we click on courses we can find notes and attachments
Check allow search and launch new custom tab wizard.
Add Notes and Attachments related list to default page layout

Object is not added in the tab list how can i use then 
->Click on Home
->Search for Tabs
->custom Object Tabs ->New button->can select the style and next->next->select all->save


We can use Schema Builder and add the elements by drag and drop but after adding when we refresh these when i click on edit other fields are not coming since they are not required fields this is the drawback.If we don't add a field as required it won't be available.

Trainer->Page Layout->Drag and Drop the sections

How to add Users
->Home->Users->
First Name,Lastname,email id of that user account,Nick Name user1234,This User belongs to which region (eg:English),Local settings:Lang:English ->save

Mail will be received to that user.Being ane Administrator I want to give permission to the that user.
Standard User->Giving Permissions

From now onwards another user also can create and add courses as showing as he is the owner.
